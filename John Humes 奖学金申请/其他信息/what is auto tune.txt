🎵 1. Auto-Tune in Music (Common Usage)
This is the most well-known meaning, referring to audio processing technology used to correct vocal pitch. It was developed by Antares Audio Technologies.

✅ Core underlying algorithms:
Pitch Detection: Often uses algorithms like YIN, AMDF, Cepstrum, or FFT-based spectral analysis to detect the current pitch.

Pitch Correction: Once pitch is detected, it is adjusted to the nearest musical note. Common techniques include:

Time-domain stretching/compression

Phase vocoder

PSOLA (Pitch Synchronous Overlap and Add)

🚀 Effects:
It can subtly correct pitch for natural vocal enhancement

Or produce robotic and synthetic effects (e.g., T-Pain style)

🔍 2. "Auto-Tuning" in Research Papers (Non-Music Usage)
In fields like control engineering, optimization, and computer science, “Auto-Tuning” often refers to:

Automatically adjusting parameters to optimize a system’s performance.

Examples:
Tuning hyperparameters in machine learning models (e.g., learning rate, batch size)

Adjusting compiler settings in high-performance computing

Auto-tuning PID controllers in control systems

Common fields:
Deep Learning: AutoML, hyperparameter tuning

HPC (High-Performance Computing): Compiler optimization

Control Theory: Adaptive control systems

✅ How to search more precisely?
If you’re looking for music-related Auto-Tune, try searching:

"Auto-Tune" + pitch correction

"Pitch correction algorithm"

"Real-time pitch shifting"

If you see “Auto-Tuning” in a paper that’s unrelated to audio, it most likely refers to automated parameter optimization.
